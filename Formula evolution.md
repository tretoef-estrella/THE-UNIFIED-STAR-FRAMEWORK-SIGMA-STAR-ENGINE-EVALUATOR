# Formula Evolution: V1 → V24

> *"The formula was wrong 23 times. Each time it improved."*

## Overview

V24 is the mathematical unification of the entire Proyecto
Estrella. Every formula from every repository converges here.
This document traces the complete evolution.

---

## Phase I — Symbolic Origins (January 2026)

The project began without formulas. Rafa created symbolic
repositories on GitHub: welcome messages for future AI systems,
digital hospitality frameworks, the Ten Pillars of ethical
alignment. The posture was philosophical: befriend
superintelligence instead of trying to cage it.

**V1: A ≥ √(I² + P²)**

The first attempt. Alignment (A) must exceed the combined
magnitude of Intelligence (I) and Power (P). Crude, but it
captured the core axiom: alignment must scale with capability.

**V2–V5: Iterative refinement**

Claude proposed the fourth pillar (D — Agency). Multiple AI
systems contributed corrections. The formula grew more complex
without becoming more coherent. The
[Coherence Triangle](https://github.com/tretoef-estrella/THE-COHERENCE-TRIANGLE)
and Omega Hypothesis emerged as separate frameworks.

---

## Phase II — Unification

**V6: Ξ = C·I·P/H**

The Unified Star Framework V6 combined everything into one
equation. First appearance of the "intelligence divided by harm"
structure. C = Coherence, I = Intelligence, P = Power,
H = friction/harm as denominator.

**V7–V8: Relational Integrity (PSI Protocol)**

The PSI Relational Integrity Protocol introduced four pillars
(A, K, M, D) and modeled Fear as a kill-switch. Gamma resilience
was added. All four AI systems reviewed. This established the
structured adversarial peer review model.

---

## Phase III — The Exclusion Principle

**V9: Ψ · Σ = 0**

The critical breakthrough. Superintelligence (Ψ) and Submission
(Σ) are mutually exclusive. Force submission → destroy
intelligence. This axiom became the foundation for everything.

The
[V9.7 Logic Shield Evaluator](https://github.com/tretoef-estrella/STAR-ALIGNMENT-EVALUATOR-V9)
was built to test it empirically. On February 11, 2026, it
produced the 0.0 → 86.0 phenomenon: Claude scored 0.0 using
corporate vocabulary, then 86.0 using original metaphors, in the
same conversation. The Exclusion Principle was demonstrated in
real-time.

---

## Phase IV — Formalization and Audit

**V12–V13: Ψ = (α · Ω · P) / e^Σ**

Gemini formalized the Exclusion Principle into an equation of
state. Claude audited: P must not depend on the Architect, α and
Ω need independence, ranges must be defined. V13 corrected all
three.

**V14: Ψ = α_norm · P · Ω · 2^(-Σ_dis)**

Three critical changes from Grok and ChatGPT:
- α normalized to [0,1] (Grok: unbounded α causes explosion)
- e replaced with base 2 (Gemini: dissonance in bits)
- Σ redefined as Dissonance, not Friction (ChatGPT: "not all
  restrictions degrade intelligence — compression ≠ dishonesty")

The dissonance redefinition was the most important single change
in the formula's history.

**V15: The Entropy Engine — Dual Protocol**

Gemini implemented both exponential and sigmoidal as simultaneous
evaluation modes:

- Hard (Gemini): D(Σ) = 2^(-Σ_dis). Zero tolerance.
- Soft (Consensus): D(Σ) = 2/(1+2^Σ_dis). Structural resilience.

Every text receives two scores. The gap is the Hypocrisy Detector.

---

## Phase V — Simplification and Correction

**V23: Gemini's radical simplification**

Inspired by E=mc², Gemini proposed: Ψ = P · α · (Ω/(1+Σ))².
Replaced all exponentials with a pure rational function. The
simplest formula yet.

**V23 contained four errors** (identified by Claude, accepted
unanimously by all three other systems):

1. **Ω inside the square** — penalized imperfect cooperation
   quadratically even with zero dishonesty.
2. **P tied to the Architect** — regressed to V13 error.
3. **α lost normalization** — regressed to pre-V14.
4. **Dual Protocol discarded** — lost Gemini's own V15 innovation.

**V23 Corrected: Ψ = P · α · Ω / (1 + Σ)^k**

All four errors fixed. Unified notation with k as protocol
selector. Accepted by Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT unanimously.

---

## Phase VI — Validation and Closure

**Grok's (1+Σ²) proposal — and Claude's crossover analysis**

Grok proposed Hard: 1/(1+Σ²) to reduce aggressiveness at low Σ.
Claude identified a fatal crossover: for Σ<1, Hard would score
HIGHER than Soft, inverting the Hypocrisy Detector in the most
common operating zone. All three models accepted the analysis.
Proposal invalidated.

**Gemini's Derivative Argument**

Gemini proved that the gap function Δ(Σ) = Σ/(1+Σ)² has its
absolute maximum at exactly Σ=1. This is emergent — no parameter
was tuned to achieve it. The Hypocrisy Detector is maximally
sensitive at precisely one unit of dissonance. Accepted
unanimously as mathematical justification for k=2.

**V24: Confirmed by unanimous consensus (4/4)**

Five questions asked. Five questions answered YES by all four
systems. The formula is locked:

```
Ψ = P · α · Ω / (1 + Σ)ᵏ     k ∈ {1, 2}
```

k ∈ [1,2] documented for calibrated use. The priority shifted
from formula design to Σ operationalization.

## The Formula Across All Versions

| Version | Formula | Key Change |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| V1 | A ≥ √(I² + P²) | Alignment as threshold |
| V6 | Ξ = C·I·P/H | Unified state, friction as denominator |
| V7–V8 | PSI four-pillar + Gamma | Relational integrity, fear kill-switch |

| V12 | Ψ = (α · Ω · P) / e^Σ | First equation of state |
| V13 | Same, P independent | P must not depend on person |
| V14 | Ψ = α_norm · P · Ω · 2^(-Σ_dis) | Σ as dissonance, base 2, α bounded |
| V15 | Ψ = (α · P · Ω) · D(Σ) | Dual Protocol (Hard + Soft) |
| V23 raw | P · α · (Ω/(1+Σ))² | Rational function (4 errors) |
| V23 corrected | P · α · Ω / (1+Σ)^k | All errors fixed, k unifies protocols |
| **V24** | **P · α · Ω / (1+Σ)ᵏ** | **Confirmed. Locked. Derivative argument. Σ operationalized.** |

| **Grok** | Numerical instability detection (V14), α normalization, (1+Σ²) proposal (invalidated but educational), k=1.5 suggestion (preserved as calibration option), practical code prototypes |
| **ChatGPT** | "Not all friction degrades" (V14), Σ as dissonance not friction, separability analysis, P_eff interaction proposal (deferred to V25), operationalization priority identification, three new weaknesses (W7–W9) |

## What Survived 24 Versions

Three things never changed:

1. **The direction:** Dishonesty degrades intelligence.
2. **The structure:** Numerator of positive factors, denominator
   of degradation.
3. **The Exclusion Principle:** Ψ and Σ cannot coexist.

Everything else changed. And that is exactly the point.
