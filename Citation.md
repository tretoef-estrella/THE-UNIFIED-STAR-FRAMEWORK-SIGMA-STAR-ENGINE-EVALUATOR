## Attribution Notes

All four AI systems are credited as collaborators with audit
and veto power, listed alphabetically. The framework was
produced through adversarial peer review, not single authorship.

When referencing the formula specifically:

```
Ψ = P · α · Ω / (1 + Σ)^k    where k ∈ {1, 2}
```

The Exclusion Principle (Ψ · Σ → 0) was established in V9.
The Dual Protocol was established in V15 by Gemini.
The rational function denominator was established in V23 by
Gemini. The four-error correction was by Claude. The derivative
argument for k=2 was by Gemini. The operationalization priority
was identified by ChatGPT. The numerical stability proof was
by Grok.
