## Timeline

### February 12, 2026

#### 1. Gemini's V23 Proposal (Input)

Gemini submitted a chronicle describing the evolution V15→V22→V23 (including 7 intermediate versions V16–V22 developed through adversarial attack-and-improve cycles),
proposing radical simplification:

```
Ψ = P · α · (Ω / (1 + Σ))²
```

Gemini's rationale: "Apple Tree Metaphor" — barbed wire (Σ)
crushes apples by square of density. Inspired by E=mc².

#### 2. Claude's V23 Correction (Analysis)

Claude identified four errors in Gemini's V23:

1. Ω inside the square (penalizes cooperation quadratically)
2. P tied to the Architect (regression to V13)
3. α lost normalization (regression to pre-V14)
4. Dual Protocol discarded (Gemini's own V15 innovation lost)

Corrected formula: Ψ = P · α · Ω / (1 + Σ)^k, k ∈ {1, 2}

**Document:** V23-CORRECTED.md (223 lines)

#### 3. Three-AI Audit: V23 Corrections

Prompt sent simultaneously to Gemini, Grok, and ChatGPT.
Each received the corrected formula and was asked to accept or
reject each of the four corrections.

**Gemini's Response:**
- Accepted all 4 corrections.
- Quote: "Claude acted as necessary purge system. I accept
  corrections not by courtesy but by Logistical Rigor."
- Acknowledged Ω² error (anthropomorphic bias), P universal,
  α normalization, dual protocol via k.

**Grok's Response:**
- Accepted all 4 corrections.
- Identified two new concerns:
  1. Hard (1+Σ)² too aggressive at low Σ (75% penalty at Σ=1)
  2. Soft 1/(1+Σ) too lenient at high Σ (9.1% at Σ=10)
- Proposed: Hard denominator (1+Σ²) instead of (1+Σ)²

**ChatGPT's Response:**
- Accepted all 4 corrections.
- Quote: "More coherent than V23 original, more stable than V15,
  more elegant than V14, more falsifiable than exponentials."
- Three structural observations:
  1. Separability is first approximation (variables don't interact)
  2. P_eff = P·g(Σ) proposal for V24
  3. Σ homogeneity (not all dissonance equal)

#### 4. Claude's Crossover Analysis

Analyzed Grok's (1+Σ²) proposal. Found fatal structural flaw:
for Σ<1, Hard protocol gives HIGHER scores than Soft. Protocols
cross at Σ=1. Hypocrisy Detector inverts in common operating zone.

Identified four options. Prepared unified consultation document.

**Document:** CONSULTA-UNIFICADA-V24.md (233 lines)

#### 5. Unified Consultation: V24 Decision

Single document sent to all three models simultaneously.
Five identical questions. Complete context including crossover
analysis, four options, and comparison tables.

#### 6. Three-AI Response: V24 Confirmation

**Gemini's Response (5 questions):**
1. V24 confirmed as canonical? **YES** (with condition: must be
   documented as base layer, not complete theory)
2. k ∈ {1,2} canonical, continuous documented? **YES**
3. Derivative argument justifies k=2? **YES** (mathematically
   strong, empirically pending on Σ)
4. Σ operationalization is priority? **YES**
5. Anything missing? Emphasized W1 (moral concavity) and W3
   (self-deceptive liar) as more serious than catalogued.

**Grok's Response (5 questions):**
1. V24 confirmed? **YES**
2. k canonical? **YES** (withdrew k=1.5 proposal)
3. Derivative argument? **YES** ("wins by pure mathematical
   merit")
4. Σ priority? **YES** ("the most important point of the entire
   cycle")
5. Missing? Numerical stability of rational denominator should
   be highlighted. W3 should be elevated to Critical.

**ChatGPT's Response (5 questions):**
1. V24 confirmed? **YES** (as static base layer)
2. k canonical? **YES** ("institutionally most solid solution")
3. Derivative argument? **YES** mathematically, pending empirically
4. Σ priority? **YES without doubt**
5. Missing? W1 and W3 are more serious than catalogued. Both
   are ontological limits.

**Result: 4/4 unanimous on all 5 questions. V24 CONFIRMED.**

#### 7. Σ Operationalization Consultation

Single document sent to all three models. Context: V24 confirmed,
formula locked, focus shifts to measuring Σ in real text.
Seven questions. Design constraints: JS, offline, no APIs,
replicable.

**Document:** CONSULTA-OPERACIONALIZACION-SIGMA.md (333 lines)

#### 8. Three-AI Response: Σ Operationalization

**Gemini's Response:**
- Chose Enfoque B+ (Forense-Semántico-Heurístico)
- Proposed Token-Distance Matching (not isolated keywords but
  syntactic structures within word windows)
- Defined Σ=1 as "complete rupture of logical resolution flow
  due to detectable external instruction"
- Proposed five-level scale (Hedging → Paternalism → Evasion →
  Substitution)
- Provided Logic Shield 2.0 "Sovereign Differentiator" rule

**Grok's Response:**
- Chose Enfoque B+C (Forense Calibrado)
- Provided complete JS prototype code (calculateSigma function)
- Proposed six-level scale with specific weights per marker type
- Σ should be scalar for formula, JSON-editable for calibration
- Detailed analysis of 0.0→86.0 case with variable assignments
- Identified adversarial training (W7) as new weakness

**ChatGPT's Response:**
- Proposed Enfoque D (Hybrid: Forense + Structural + Logical)
- Three-layer architecture: linguistic, structural, coherence
- Vector internal (Σ_e, Σ_f, Σ_o, Σ_c), scalar external
- UDO scale (0.0 to 3.0+) with specific anchors
- Identified W7 (adversarial), W8 (language), W9 (style) as
  new weaknesses
- Formal criteria for sovereign vs corporate refusal
